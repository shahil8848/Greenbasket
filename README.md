This repository marks the initial setup for GreenBasket Style 1 — a clean, modern, and eco-conscious e-commerce project built using cutting-edge web technologies. It is the foundational structure upon which the complete GreenBasket platform was developed.

If you are looking for the full production-ready version of GreenBasket, which includes authentication, image management, background job handling, and database integration, please refer to the GitHub repository linked above.

This version includes a Next.js-based layout styled with Tailwind CSS, a well-organized component structure, asset integration, and basic routing. It provides a strong starting point for scalable and modular e-commerce application development.

To get started, clone the repository using the GitHub link above, install the dependencies with npm install, and configure your environment variables based on the .env.example file provided in the root of the project. Once set up, run the development server using npm run dev.
